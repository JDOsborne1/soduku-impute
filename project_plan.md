# Project Plan


## Research Existing Imputation Strategies


## Design and Build implementation of Soduku Imputation


## Build Framework of testing imputation methods
There are more metrics for evaluating performance than just accuracy, although it will likely be the most versatile. 

Current intuition is that the accuracy score will be the basis of a lower bound for use and that other metrics, such as Sensitivity, will play a role in selecting the best model for a given occation. 

## Test and iterate Soduku-Impute recording all results
Ideally this would take the form of some sort of re-usable testing suite. 
__Look into Leveraging a suite that already exists__


## Write Up significant discoveries

As a research goal and for own purposes, it would be good to get a good picture of what systems problems correspond to which metrics to decide on the best performing algorithm.
